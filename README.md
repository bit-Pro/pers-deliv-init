# Individual deliverables
From time to time throughout the semester you may be required to submit individual work. In order to keep everyone's work safe and easy for me to find, all work must be submitted to me by adding it to your individual deliverable repo.

Please keep this repo tidy and well-organised. If I can't find your work in under two minutes, I will consider it missing.
